MATLAB code for Restaurant Tipping Problem using Conventional Control.
The following code provides the use of a conventional method in a Restaurant Tipping Problem. There are many sections to go through and understand the process with steady progress in the coding. However, it can be better solved using fuzzy logic. It is uploaded to understand the implementation of such a problem if fuzzy logic is not used and very basic of Matlab needs to be used.
